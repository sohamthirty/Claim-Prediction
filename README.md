# Claim Prediction in Travel Insurances

## Abstract
*Travel Insurance is a coverage plan
designed to protect a person from certain financial
risks and losses that can occur while travelling. The
project proposes to predict the status of the claims
handled by an insurance servicing company based in
Singapore using Machine learning. This analysis leads
to the identification of the influential features for price
optimization and risk assessment.*

**Key Words â€“ Travel Insurance Claims, Influential
Features, Machine Learning.**

## Introduction

An Insurance claim is a formal request made by a
person to the insurance company for receiving money to
pay for the repairs or other expenses in compliance with
the insuring agreement. The losses range from minor
like delayed suitcase, missed airline connections to
significant ones like injuries, last-minute trip
cancellation and damage to personal property. The
problem is to predict whether a travel insurance with
specific attribute values would result into a claim or not
using the given dataset **[1]** having 60k+ records.
Forecasting the upcoming claims helps the insurance
companies to determine the events, information, or
certain factors that impact the results. Insurers can then
charge competitive premiums for improving the price
models. This analysis can also benefit the claims
department to mitigate and identify the risks that
unexpectedly become high cost (outlier claims) **[2].**
Eventually, this would help the company take better
informed decisions.

## Modelling Algorithms used

- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- CatBoost  

## Added Cross Validation

**The data is imbalanced with skewed class proportions as the Insurances with Claimed Status make only 1.4% of total claims**
